#+TITLE: SpeechState starter project

** Getting started
1. You need [[https://nodejs.org/en][Node.js (LTS version)]] and [[https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install][Yarn package manager]].
2. Clone ~SpeechState~ (https://github.com/vladmaraev/speechstate) into
   a sibling directory.
3. Switch to ~no-react~ branch. 
4. Install the dependencies and build ~SpeechState~:
   #+begin_src sh
     yarn
     npx tsc
   #+end_src
5. Clone this project. 
6. Link ~SpeechState~ (from this project):
   #+begin_src sh
     yarn link ../speechstate -A -p -r
   #+end_src
7. Add Azure key in ~src/index.ts~
8. Install the dependencies and start the application:
   #+begin_src
     yarn
     yarn start
   #+end_src

Some considerations:
1. Yarn (update to last version:  ~yarn set version stable~, see ~.yarnrc.yml~)
2. Cleaning parcel cache: ~rm -rf .parcel-cache~
